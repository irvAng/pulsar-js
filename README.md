# pulsar-js
A pulsar synthsizer based on Curtis Roads' Microsound. (in progress).

Pulsar synthesizer including features described on Curtis Roads' Microsound book. 

The idea of this project is to build the synthesizer using the Web Audio API. The API offers the ability to manipulate sound at the sample level, thus allowing for control of sound at a very fundamental level: the sample level.
